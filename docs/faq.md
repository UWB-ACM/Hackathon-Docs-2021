# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What should I do to get ready for the event?
- Register.
- Make a note of the event dates, and take a look at the event schedule the day before.
- Prepare your workspace. Get power cords, monitors, snacks, and anything else you feel would get you comfortable and ready to go.
- Install Zoom if you do not already have it. We will be using Zoom for Opening and Ending ceremonies, as well as any other presentations.
- Install Discord and create an account if you do not already have one. This will be the most convenient way to connect with the Organizers.
- Install git and familiarize yourself with its basic functionality. Version Control will be essential for online collaboration.
- Review the instructions.

## How should I keep in touch with my team?
We recommend using Zoom, Slack, Discord, Teams, or other platform to keep in touch with your team. We suggest you begin the event by discussing scheduling with your team. Decide when you plan to work, whether you want to break in the evenings and reconvene in the mornings, when you want to break for meals, and if anyone has times they'll be unavailable. 

## How can I contact the Organizers for questions?
The organizers will be available on Discord and Zoom for help. We'll provide more information on how this will work as we approach the event.

## How do I submit my project?
We'll be using DevPost to accept submissions.
